In the documentation below, **all text preceded by ⏵** can be clicked to reveal more text.

## Installation of the plugin

<details><summary><i>Click for installation instructions…</i></summary>

1. **Download the plugin\_PoLaR.zip file**

* Get the **zip file ([plugin_PoLaR.zip](https://github.com/ByronAhn/PoLaR-Praat-plugin/blob/main/plugin_PoLaR.zip?raw=true))** from GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/ByronAhn/PoLaR-Praat-plugin/blob/main/plugin_PoLaR.zip?raw=true)
* Unzip the file, and you should find a new folder `plugin_PoLaR`
	- We will move this folder shortly

2. **Navigate to your “Praat preferences” directory**

* On Windows, if your username is xxyyzz, your “Praat preferences” directory is: `C:\Users\xxyyzz\Praat\`
* On Linux, your “Praat preferences” directory is in your home directory, namely at: `~/.praat-dir/`
* On a Mac, your “Praat preferences” directory is in your user Library folder, more specifically at: `~/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/`
    - **NOTE:** On a Mac, this folder is in a hidden directory. To get there, use the “Go To Folder” functionality Finder by opening up a Finder window, and hitting `[SHIFT]+[CMD]+G`.
	- (_more details on [this page of the Apple support site](https://support.apple.com/en-gw/guide/mac-help/mchlp1236/mac)_)
* In all cases, if you do not see your directory there, you may need to create it.
    - (_If you have trouble, navigate to [this page on the Praat manual](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/preferences_folder.html), where finding this directory is described in a different way_)

3. **Move the unzipped `plugin_PoLaR` to this directory**

* Take the `plugin_PoLaR` folder that you unzipped and move it to Praat preferences directory
* This `plugin_PoLaR` folder _**must**_ be found _**immediately**_ inside the “Praat preferences” directory
	- i.e., on Windows, `C:\Users\xxyyzz\Praat\plugin_PoLaR\`
	- i.e., on Linux, `~/.praat-dir/plugin_PoLaR/`
	- i.e., on a Mac, `~/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/plugin_PoLaR/`

4. **Double check location of files**

* Importantly: the `setup.praat` file must be found just inside this `plugin_Praat` directory, **_WITHOUT_** any extra directories in between
	- And the `praatScripts` folder must be in the same directory as `setup.praat`
* So for example the setup.praat file needs to be here:
	- on Windows, `C:\Users\xxyyzz\Praat\plugin_PoLaR\setup.praat`
	- on Linux, `~/.praat-dir/plugin_PoLaR/setup.praat`
	- on a Mac, `~/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/plugin_PoLaR/setup.praat`
* If not already there, move the `setup.praat` file (and the `praatScripts` directory) to the right location

5. **If Praat is open, (save all your files and) quit the application and restart it**

    * After restarting, the plug-in is installed, and the new menu commands or buttons will be ready to use!

## What Can You Do with the PoLaR plugin


1. <details open id="adjust-view"><summary><i>Adjust Pitch/Spectrogram viewing settings</i></summary>

	* <details><summary><b>Set the Spectrogram/Pitch view settings</b></summary>

		* Sets a variety of pitch / spectrogram settings, so as to ensure uniform viewing across files / individuals
		* For pitch view settings, this either uses…
			- …a simple algorithm defined in [Daniel Hirst's Momel plugin](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342039069_plugin_momel-intsint), or…
			- …the values in the Ranges tier (if present)
		* This function is _only_ available in an Editor window showing a Sound (and TextGrid)

		</details>
	</details>

2. <details open id="create-textgrid-for-sounds"><summary><i>Create New PoLaR TextGrid for Sound(s)</i></summary>

	1. <details id="blank-polar-for-sound"><summary><b>New Blank PoLaR TextGrid for Sound</b></summary>

		* This creates blank TextGrids with PolaR tiers, where the duration of the TextGrid matches the duration of the Sound

		</details>

	2. <details id="momel-based-polar-for-sound"><summary><b>New TextGrid with Momel-based labels</b></summary>

		* This creates a TextGrids with PoLaR tiers
		* AND uses the Momel-based algorithms (described in bullet 4.i, below) to fill in the Points, Levels, and Ranges tiers
		* macOS users: see warning in bullet 4.i

		</details>

	</details>

3. <details open id="modify-inspect"><summary><i>Modify/Inspect PoLaR TextGrids</i></summary>

	1. <details id="Add-missing-PoLaR-tiers"><summary><b>Add missing PoLaR tiers</b></summary>

		* Adds any PoLaR tiers that aren't yet present in the Textgrid
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid(s) in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid (and Sound) in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid in an entire directory

		</details>

	2. <details id="Clear-PoLaR-tiers"><summary><b>Clear PoLaR tiers</b></summary>

		* Removes any labels from the PoLaR tiers, and replaces them with blank tiers
		* Can be run on any selected TextGrid(s) in the Objects window

		</details>

	3. <details id="Clear-PoLaR-tiers-and-delete-others"><summary><b>Clear PoLaR tiers and delete other (non-PoLaR) tiers</b></summary>

		* Removes any labels from the PoLaR tiers, and replaces them with blank tiers
		* **_ALSO_** deletes all other tiers (except Words and Phones tiers), leaving **_only_** blank PoLaR tiers
		* Can be run on any selected TextGrid(s) in the Objects window

		</details>

	4. <details id="Consensus-Helper"> <summary><b>Consensus Helper (beta)</b></summary>

		* Tries to automatically resolve any different advanced labels from two different .TextGrid files into consenus labels
			- Where it can't resolve labels automatically, a (large) TextGrid is created showing relevant labels from both TextGrid files, leaving the rest of the consenus work to the human labellers
			- For more details, see the separate guide in `PoLaR-Conensus-Helper.md`
		* Can be run when 1 Sound object *and* 2 TextGrid objects are selected in the Object window

		</details>

	5. <details id="Extract-info-from-PoLaR-tiers"><summary><b>Extract info from PoLaR tiers</b></summary>

		* Gather a large number of measures (timing, f0, etc.) of various aspects of a Sound, based on a corresponding PoLaR-labelled TextGrid
			- This will collect and organize PoLaR labels as well as some measures associated with them, which is output to the Praat Info window
			- That information is organized with a header and with elements separated by tabs, so it can be copy-pasted easily into a spreadsheet
			- Data in this format facilitates further analysis in spreadsheets / statistical software
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid+Sound pair(s) in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid+Sound pair in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid+Sound pair in an entire directory

		</details>
	</details>

4. <details open id="generate-polar"><summary><i>Generate PoLaR labels for an existing TextGrid</i></summary>

	1. <details id="polar-based-on-momel"><summary><b>New Points/Levels/Ranges based on Momel</b></summary>

		* Generates labels on the Points / Levels / Ranges tiers, using the algorithms/code from the Momel-INTSINT Plugin
			- First: it estimates appropriate values for f0 min/max for evaluation
			- Next: using an algortihm described in Hirst 2011, the momel app identifies f0 turning points, and puts them in a PitchTier object
			- Last: the f0 values for the highest/lowest Points turning points are used to estimate a Ranges size, and Levels values are created
		* After this is done, the script will save the PitchTier and a TextGrid with these (new) Points/Levels/Ranges labels
			- when run from the Editor/Object window, they are saved in the Object window
				* and a backup of the original TextGrid, without these new labels, is also saved to the Object window
			- when run on a directory, these .TextGrid/.PitchTier files are saved in a sub-folder called `momel_Based_TextGrids/`
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid+Sound(+PitchTier) combo(s) in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid+Sound pair in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid+Sound(+PitchTier) combo in an entire directory
		
		> [!IMPORTANT]
		> For **MAC USERS**: 
		> Because of how macOS security may try to prevent running "unknown" programs, you might need to try and run the Momel app first.
		> (_Try this if you're experiencing an error when you try to run "New Momel-based Points/Levels/Ranges"._)
		> 
		> <details><summary><b>Directions to locate/run the Momel app:</b></summary>
		> 	
		> 	* Navigate to the `momelFiles` directory in the `plugin_PoLaR` folder
		> 	* Double click on `momel_osx_intel`, and you might get a message saying:
		> 	  "`"momel_osx_intel"` cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."
		> 	* If you do, click `OK` and then right-click (or control-click) on `momel_osx_intel` and select `Open`, and now you'll get a *new* message:
		> 	  "`"momel_osx_intel"` is a Unix app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"
		> 	* Click `Open`; a Terminal window will open and show a few lines of text
		> 	* After this is done, close the Terminal window and try to run the "New Momel-based Points/Levels/Ranges" functionality again from Praat</details>

	2. <details id="levels-labels"><summary><b>New Levels Labels</b></summary>

		* Generates labels on the Levels tier for a PoLaR TextGrid that has Points and Ranges labelled
			- Any existing Levels tier labels will be replaced.
			- If no Levels tier exists, one will be created.
		* The algorithm divides up the f0 min/max defined by Range labels into 5 equally-sized quintiles
		* This is based on Hz values by default, but running "New Levels Labels (More Settings)" you can choose to use Semitones values instead

		</details>

	3. <details id="pseduo-labels"><summary><b>New Pseudo Labels</b></summary>

		* Generates "Pseudo-Categorical" labels, which resemble A-M style phonological labels
			- Some details about the algorithm are laid out in §5.1.3 of the monograph called "Embarking on PoLaR Explorations", which can be found on the [PoLaR OSF repository](https://osf.io/usbx5/)
		* Running this script requires that **_ALL_** PoLaR tiers are annotated, and that the Points tier contains **_ADVANCED_** PoLaR labels
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid(s) in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid (and Sound) in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid in an entire directory
	
		</details> 
	</details>
	
5. <details open id="assess-points"><summary><i>Assess pitch turning points</i></summary>

	1. <details id="Adjust-Points-audio-visually"><summary><b>Adjust Points audio/visually, in a Manipulation window</b></summary>

		* Opens three windows
			- an Editor window with the original Sound+TextGrid pair
			- a Manipulation window for a Sound, where all pitch points are at the time,f0 coordinates from the PoLaR Points tier
			- a pop-up window with the button to press when editing is done
		* The user then moves the existing pitch points, add new ones, delete existing ones, etc.
			- while the Manipulation window is open, the user can select portions of the recording, and hear its straight-line approximation
			- this facilitates direct comparison with the original recording (which is also open)
			  > [!NOTE]
			  > To further facilitate direct comparison between the straight-line approximation and the original recording, ensure the "Group" checkbox in the bottom-right of the Manipulation and Editor windows is **ticked**.
			  >  When it is ticked, selecting a stretch of time in the Manipulation window automatically selects the _exact same_ stretch of time in the Editor window.
		* When the user is finished, they can select "Save Changes" in the pop-up window
			- This saves the pitch points in the Manipulation window to the TextGrid's Points tier
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid+Sound(+PitchTier) combo(s) in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid+Sound pair in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid+Sound(+PitchTier) combo in an entire directory
		
		</details>

	2. <details id="Resynthesize-SLA"><summary><b>Resynthesize Straight Line Approximation</b></summary>

		* Resynthesizes a Sound, with a straight-line approximation of the f0 contour, based on the PoLaR points tier and f0 measurements
		* Creates a new, save-able Sound object (named the same as the original, with "-resynth" tagged onto the end)
			- Two new Praat objects are added to the Objects window (but aren't saved): the resynthesized Sound object and a Manipulation object
		* Listening to this can be used to assess whether the Points yield an appropriate sounding straight line approximation
		* Can be run on…
			- any selected TextGrid+Sound pair in the Objects window
			- an open TextGrid+Sound pair in an Editor window
			- every TextGrid+Sound pair in an entire directory

		</details>
	</details>

6. <details open id="create-drawings"><summary><i>Create PoLaR-styled Sound(+Textgrid) Drawings</i></summary>

	* <details><summary><b>Produce stylized Sound/TextGrid drawings</b></summary>

		* Creates a drawing with the f0 track overlaid on top of a spectrogram for the Sound object
			- If there is a TextGrid as well, its labels are shown underneath
			- (This simulates the display for a View & Edit window)
		* If run with the menu item ending in "(More Settings)", a window opens with many more options and parameters that can be set

		</details>
