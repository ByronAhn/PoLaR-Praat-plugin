# First we need to select the TextGrid and Sound objects that are open in the TextGridEditor.
# This works in a weird way: Praat loads a TextGrid and Sound in the "View & Edit" window by loading the TextGrid directly,
# but the Sound object is a copy of the original Sound object. (So the original Sound object cannot be referred to directly.)
# To get around this (in case the relevant Sound object is not currently selected), this script selects the entire Sound file
# and extracts it to the Objects window. So the TextGrid that is used by this script is the original, and the Sound object
# that is used is a copy.
